Website Ideas


https://do-it.org/ 
like the home page layout style

https://www.psychiatry.org/
like that the site uses the entire screen
like the responsive design
like the home page layout style
like the clean, simple design
like the streamlined list in the drop downs
like the changing side bar in each main section that has more detail than the drop down

http://www.aao.org/
like that the buttons don’t have drop downs, but when you get to the individual sections, each section has a new row of buttons and they have drop downs (although I think it is weird that you have to click the button to make the drop down appear); Also like how they deal with this in the responsive design by have a button that says Menu for the options in that section

http://www.entnet.org/
like the layout with the and the three levels of buttons at the top; well organized
on the home page, like the sections: Featured, What’s New and then the image boxes on the right

Toufic,
 
Please see the attached changes for the home page wireframe. Also, on www.acponline.org we like the cool big image box on their home page and the functionality of the box (there are 3 like you proposed for us, and they aren’t a slider, but they do move from right to left if you click on the second and third image, but the really cool thing is you can still see your other two options).
 
We also like the extensive site map at the bottom of the www.acponline.org site.
